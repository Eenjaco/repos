   - Check if branch is up to date with remote
   - Show git status

2. **Review Recent Work** (last 3-5 sessions):
   - Read SESSION_NOTES.md if it exists
   - Summarize what was accomplished recently
   - List major features implemented
   - Note any bug fixes or optimizations

3. **Check Pending Items**:
   - Review SESSION_NOTES.md for "Pending Ideas"
   - Check for TODO comments in code
   - Look for any incomplete features mentioned in docs
   - List items that were discussed but NOT implemented

4. **Documentation Review**:
   - List key documentation files in docs/
   - Note any ROADMAP or STATUS files
   - Check for implementation guides

5. **Environment Check**:
   - Verify key dependencies are installed
   - Check if any processes are running (e.g., training data processing)
   - Note any background tasks

6. **Present Session Briefing**:
   Create a concise briefing with:
   - 📋 Recent accomplishments (last 1-3 sessions)
   - ⏳ Pending tasks/ideas from previous sessions
   - 🎯 Suggested next priorities
   - ⚠️ Any blockers or issues to address
   - 💡 Ideas mentioned but not yet implemented

7. **Ask User**:
   - What would you like to work on today?
   - Should we tackle pending items or start something new?

Present everything in a clean, organized format that gives context for continuing work.
